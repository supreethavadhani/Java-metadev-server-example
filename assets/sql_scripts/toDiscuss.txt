1. enrolled_students -> student_enrollments

2. no generated primary key. student+season is the primary key. This is not a foreign key in any other table as of now.

3. sgpa and cgpa are added as attributes to student_enrollment. the two table are removed

4. offered_subjects has subject+season as primary key. no offered_subject_id

5. test_names changed to tests

6. is_integrated added to subjects.

7. we should have lists for integrated/non-integerated/current subject lists

8. can we do away with subject_enrollments, and go straight to subject_sections

9. test-attendance: shift it to where test marks is entered

10. test_marks deleted. makrs added to student_tests

11. subject_results deleted. result_type_id added to subjects

12. result_marks deleted. any attribute to be added to subject_register

13. when do we add rows into student_tests?

14. eligible_students deleted. is_eligible added to student_tests

15. hall_tickets is at subject_level. is_printed shifted to student_enrollments

16. test_types: we should look for a better name, because it is not like user-type or guardian-type
    It actually represents one or more actual tests. It is more a group than a type.
